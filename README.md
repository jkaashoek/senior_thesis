# Senior Thesis README
Code base for undergraduate thesis

## Code

The code is separated into three Jupyter notebooks.

**dynamic_mode_decomp.ipynb**: Chapter 2 code to perform dynamic mode decomposition.
**clustering.ipynb**: code to run a hierarchical and k-means clustering on county death series, as described in Chapter 3.
**political_analysis.ipynb**: the remaining Chapter 3 code that performs the descriptive and regression analysis as well as generate figures.

## Data

The data folder contains publically available and self-generated datasets that I used in Chapter 3.

**centers.csv**: cluster centers, as generated by clustering.ipynb
**cluster_assignment.csv**: a mapping from county FIPS id to cluster assignment, as determined in clustering.ipynb.
**PLACES__Local_Data_for_Better_Health__County_Data_2020_release**: CDC PLACES dataset containing obesity data. [Original data source.](https://nccd.cdc.gov/PLACES/rdPage.aspx?rdReport=DPH_500_Cities.ComparisonReport). 
**time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv**: US county-level COVID-19 deaths from Johns Hopkins. The last data pull was February 12, 2021.

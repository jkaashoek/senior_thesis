# Senior Thesis README
Code base for undergraduate thesis

## Code

The code is separated into three Jupyter notebooks.

* **dynamic_mode_decomp.ipynb**: Chapter 2 code to perform dynamic mode decomposition.
* **clustering.ipynb**: code to run a hierarchical and k-means clustering on county death series, as described in Chapter 3.
* **political_analysis.ipynb**: the remaining Chapter 3 code that performs the descriptive and regression analyses as well as generate figures.

## Data

The data folder contains publically available and self-generated datasets that I used in Chapter 3.

* **centers.csv**: cluster centers, as generated by clustering.ipynb
* **cluster_assignment.csv**: a mapping from county FIPS id to cluster assignment, as determined in clustering.ipynb.
* **governor_affiliation.csv**: Self-generated party affiliations of governors. This dataset is not really used in the code anymore but was at one point. [Original data table.](https://ballotpedia.org/Partisan_composition_of_governors)
* **incarceration_trends.csv**: Incarceration data provided by the VERA Institute. [Original data source.](https://github.com/vera-institute/incarceration-trends)
* **International_Report_Passengers.csv**: International travel data provided by the Department of Transportation. [Original data source.](https://data.transportation.gov/Aviation/International_Report_Passengers/xgub-n9bw) 
* **nursing.csv**: Nursing home data provided by CMS. [Original data source.](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/4pq5-n9py)
* **OxCGRT_US_latest.csv**: COVID-19 government interventions in the US provided by OxCGRT. [Original data source.](https://github.com/OxCGRT/USA-covid-policy) 
* **PLACES__Local_Data_for_Better_Health__County_Data_2020_release.csv**: PLACES dataset containing obesity data provided by the CDC. [Original data source.](https://nccd.cdc.gov/PLACES/rdPage.aspx?rdReport=DPH_500_Cities.ComparisonReport). 
* **SVI2018_US_COUNTY.csv**: Social Vulnerability Index data provided by the CDC. [Original data source.](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/data_documentation_download.html)
* **time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv**: US county-level COVID-19 deaths from Johns Hopkins. The last data pull was February 12, 2021. [Original data source.](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

## Figures

Copies of figures. Most figures are saved as .svg files because paper figures were compiled using Powerpoint. Any figures that were included directly in the paper are saved as .pdf. Images are organized by chapter.

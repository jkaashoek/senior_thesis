# Senior Thesis README
Code base for my Applied Math undergraduate thesis. All requirements can be found in requirements.txt and can be installed with 
`pip install -r requirements.txt `


## Code

The code is separated into three Jupyter notebooks.

* **dynamic_mode_decomp.ipynb**: Chapter 2 code to perform dynamic mode decomposition.
* **clustering.ipynb**: code to run a hierarchical and k-means clustering on county death series, as described in Chapter 3.
* **political_analysis.ipynb**: the remaining Chapter 3 code that performs the descriptive and regression analyses as well as generate figures.

## Data

The data folder contains publically available and self-generated datasets that I used in Chapter 3.

* **centers.csv**: cluster centers, as generated by clustering.ipynb
* **cluster_assignment.csv**: a mapping from county FIPS id to cluster assignment, as determined in clustering.ipynb.
* **governor_affiliation.csv**: Self-generated party affiliations of governors. This dataset is not really used in the code anymore but was at one point. [Original data table.](https://ballotpedia.org/Partisan_composition_of_governors)

## Figures

Copies of figures. Most figures are saved as .svg files because paper figures were compiled using Powerpoint. Any figures that were included directly in the paper are saved as .pdf. Images are organized by chapter.
